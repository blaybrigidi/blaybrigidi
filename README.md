## About me
I build performant systems and ML-powered tools.  
Recent work includes a C++ fingerprinting engine for real-time audio search and backend services for fintech payments.  
I enjoy low-level optimization, scalable backend design, and applying ML to real-world problems.

## 💼 Experience Highlights
- **Co-Founder, Backend Engineer — TrueCreation (Audio Recognition)**  
  Engineered a C++ fingerprinting engine for sub-3s lookups across thousands of audio descriptors; scaled PostgreSQL schema to support large fingerprint counts.

- **Full Stack Developer Intern — MoneyLink (Fintech)**  
  Built Node.js APIs for cross-border payments; optimized MySQL queries to reduce API latency by ~40%.

- **AI Engineering Intern — EcoHouse**  
  Automated mortgage-document sorting with PyMuPDF + NLP and deployed a RAG search pipeline for fast document retrieval.
